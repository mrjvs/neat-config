# Why use `neat-config`

::list{type="success"}
- Load from multiple file formats (`.env`, `.json`)
- Load from environment variables
- Allows for nested configuration
- Type-safe through Zod's or Joi's schema validation
- Combine many sources into one configuration object
- partial presets through premade configuration fragments
- naming agnostic, use any naming convention and have it be converted automatically when loading in
