# Usage

Loading basic configuration is very simple.
Simply make a file in your project with any name, for this example we use `config.ts`.

Then just import `createConfigLoader` and call it. You can call any option on the builder at that point. The moment you call `load()` on your builder. it will return your configuration that has been loaded.

See the following example to load from environment variables.

::code-group
  ```ts [config.ts]
  import { createConfigLoader } from 'neat-config';

  export const config = createConfigLoader()
    .addFromEnvironment()
    .load();
  ```

## About variable naming

The loaders are naming convention agnostic. it will normalize all variable names (keys) before loading them into an object.

To illustrate, the following keys are loaded in with default configLoader settings and you can see the resulted name:
 - `HELLO_WORLD` -> `helloWorld`
 - `HelloWorld` -> `helloWorld`
 - `HELLO-WORLD` -> `helloWorld`
 - `hello_world` -> `helloWorld`
 - `Hello_World` -> `helloWorld`
 - `hello-world` -> `helloWorld`
 - `Helloworld` -> `helloworld`

## Nested values inside key-value environments

In some cases, you cannot represent complex objects in the format. For example environment variables.
For those cases you can use double underscores (`__`) to specify a nesting level.

For example

::code-group
  ```env [environment]
  FOO__BAR__BAZ=1
  FOO__BAR__BAZ_TWO=2
  HELLO_WORLD=3
  HELLO__WORLD=4
  ```

  ```js [result]
  {
    foo: {
      bar: {
        baz: "1",
        bazTwo: "2"
      }
    },
    helloWorld: "3",
    hello: {
      world: "4"
    }
  }
  ```
